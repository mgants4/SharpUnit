SharpUnit is a unit testing framework written in C# specifically for Unity3D.
It was inspired by and adapted from UUnit, which is written in Boo.
More info on UUnit can be found here:

Why SharpUnit?
- Because NUnit is not so easy to integrate into Unity3D.
- UUnit works but, while I personally like Boo, not everyone is familiar/comfortable with programming in Boo.
- SharpUnit allows you to trap/expect exceptions, UUnit does not (as of today).
- SharpUnit can easily be integrated into Unity3D but is not dependant on the Unity3DEngine namespace.
- SharpUnit can easily extended and tested outside of Unity3D and even be used for other purposes.
- SharpUnit is straight-forward and easy to use.

Getting Started:
- The Visual Studio solution contains two projects: SharpUnit and SharpUnitTest
	- SharpUnit: This is the class library that can be built to a DLL.
	- SharpUnitTest: This is a console app that runs the unit tests for SharpUnit itself.
- The Main() function in Program.cs is an example test runner, it illustrates how to get up and running with SharpUnit.
- The Unity3D_SharpUnitDemo.zip file contains an actual Unity3D 2.6 project using SharpUnit.
  
Integrate with Unity3D Using a DLL:
- Build the SharpUnit.dll from source using Visual Studio.
- Create a folder named "SharpUnit" In your Unity3D project's "Assets" folder.
- Place the SharpUnit.dll in this folder.
- Copy the Unity3D_TestRunner.cs and Unity3D_TestReporter.cs files to this folder.

Integrate with Unity3D Using the Scripts:
- Create a folder named "SharpUnit" In your Unity3D project's "Assets" folder.
- Copy the SharpUnit class files (*.cs) to this folder. 
- Copy the Unity3D_TestRunner.cs and Unity3D_TestReporter.cs files to this folder.

Running Tests in Unity3D:
- Create an empty GameObject within Unity, name it TestRunner.
- Drag the Unity3D_TestRunner.cs script onto the TestRunner game object.
- Write unit test scripts as classes derived from the TestCase class.
- Configure the TestSuite object in the Unity3D_TestRunner.cs script to run your tests.
- Press Play, you should see the test output in the Unity3D editor console.

Extending SharpUnit:
- Derive a new class from TestReporter to modify how SharpUnit reports test results and errors.
